# Installation Script For Arch Linux
A bash script that automates installation of basic utilities for my arch setup

This is a shell script I wrote in bash which you run on new installed system to speed up setup of my "Personal linux distro" :p

If you find use of it in some way feel free to incorporate in your own arch installation procedure! Of course you can and maybe even should modify it a little.
